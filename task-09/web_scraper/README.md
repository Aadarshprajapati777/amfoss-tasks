Rust is a new language for me.It took me few days to complete the task. I was able to complete the task with the help of the resources provided by amfoss. I was getting two values while scrapping the data from the site because two element used the same css class. Later I solved this problem after studying about css selector using the child method. I read vlogs and took help from youtube tutorials and google to complete this task.
